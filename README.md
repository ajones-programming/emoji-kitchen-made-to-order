### Application

Instead, now you only need
```bash
npm install && npm start
```

This will start the application on your local machine, running on [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173).

### Deployments

All application deployments are managed via GitHub Actions and the [`./.github/workflows/deploy.yml`](./.github/workflows/deploy.yml) workflow.
